Test::Directory::Diff - Testing the equivalence of file-system directories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Directory::Diff;
  
  eq_or_diff_dir $dir1, $dir2, 'Compare content of two directories';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Test::Directory::Diff> module provides a test assertion to
ensure that two given directories contain same content.  The
equivalence is determined by the C<diff> command.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The C<Test::Directory::Diff> module exports a test function by default:

=over 4

=item eq_or_diff_dir DIR1, DIR2, [NAME]

Compares the contents of two directories.  Any differences that can be
compared by the C<diff> command with C<-ur --text --new-file> options
can be detected by this test.

Note that the location of the C<diff> command and options can be
customized by C<$Test::Directory::Diff::DIFF_COMAND> and
C<@Test::Directory::Diff::DIFF_OPTION> variables.
